        Hi, I'm Anjeh. I'm currently learning to become a Full-Stack web developer. Initially, I stem from a business background but programming picked my interest because it is a very broad field and is here to stay. Also, learning this skill can offer flexibilty between careers and help one understand "the magic behind the screen". Isn't that awesome! 😄 Besides, it feels great creating my first REACT APP 😍 !
